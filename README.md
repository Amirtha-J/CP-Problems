# CP-Problems
This repository is for keeping track of the DSA problems I solve as I learn each topic. I plan to organise the problems into folders based on topics.

**This repository is part of my personal learning journey. It helps me practice, stay consistent, and revise topics efficiently**.

## Work in Progress
I will keep adding more problems as I continue learning.

## Purpose
- Practice problems while learning topics
- Keep everything organized in one place
- Make it easier to revise later

## Platforms I use for practice
- Leetcode
- Codeforces
- Codechef
- AtCoder
